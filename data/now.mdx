## 🏁 What I'm Doing Now

Right now I am a student who is focusing on my education in last year at college. Living in Karawang, it's 32 miles east of Jakarta—the capital of Indonesia.

### 📌 Also:

- Mastering Javascript modern especially Next.js
- Using and learning more about Linux and FOSS
- Following some courses, because I think it is not enough to only swallow knowledge from the campus.
- of course looking for job ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
